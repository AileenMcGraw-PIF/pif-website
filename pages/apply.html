			<p>The information in this sections outlines the criteria that your application will be evaluated against to determine if you meet the Minimum Qualifications for the position. There are two very important things to note about this step in the process:</p>

			<ul>
			  <li>Only applications found “minimally qualified” are shared with the hiring manager and are the only candidates eligible to be interviewed</li>
			  <li>The Minimum Qualification determination can only be made using the information that’s directly within your resume and directly associated your listed work experience.

			      <li>Examples of stuff that can’t be used:
			        <ul>

			          <li>Information you include in cover letters, responses to questions, etc. as these are not directly associated with your work experience</li>
			          <li>Lists of tools, technologies, programming languages, etc. that are listed separately from your work experience</li>
