			<p>We are looking for high-performing data scientists, designers, engineers, executives, innovators, product managers and technology strategists that care deeply about solving our nation’s most difficult challenges and delivering better products, services, and experiences to the American public.</p>
			<p>The Presidential Innovation Fellows program is a highly selective, non-partisan tech fellowship that pairs talented mid-to-senior-level entrepreneurs and technologists with top innovators in government leadership to take on complex projects that have the potential for significant impact. Since 2012, more than <a href="/fellows/">135 Fellows</a> have worked within more than <a href="/agencies/">35 agencies</a>.</p>
			<p>This requires Fellows to be agile, collaborative, innovative, resourceful, strategic and be able to deliver measurable results in challenging environments. Ultimately, we're hiring the holistic thinkers, digital trailblazers, and technical leaders to help define the future of government services and participate in influencing digital policy. Fellows work on building agency innovation capabilities, tackling hard problems, shaping smarter policy, and delivering on technology. We’re building products and services at scale to serve all Americans.</p>

				<li>Ensuring that the Millennium Challenge Corporation, a U.S. foreign aid agency, and their partner countries have the data, technology and innovations skills needed to maximize the impact from U.S. investments and to leverage the digital data revolution to drive their own development priorities</li>
				<li>Enabling the U.S. intelligence community can work collaboratively with the private sector to share threat information</li>
				<li>Helping the USMC conduct a digital and data transformation to keep our nation’s Marines safe</li>
