			<p>The Presidential Innovation Fellows (PIF) program is a highly selective, non-partisan tech fellowship that pairs talented mid-to-senior-level entrepreneurs and technologists with top government leaders to take on complex projects that have the potential for significant impact.</p>
			<p>The program was launched in 2012 by former U.S. Chief Technology Officer Todd Park, and since then, more than <a href="/fellows/">150 Fellows</a> have worked within over <a href="/agencies/">35 agencies</a>. Over half  of the Fellows have decided to stay in government after the PIF program, and have gone on to lead new digital teams and serve as chief technology officers, chief information officers, chief data officers, and chief marketing officers at various agencies.</p>
			<p>We’re looking for high-performing data scientists, designers, engineers, executives, innovators, product managers, and technology strategists that care deeply about solving our nation’s most difficult challenges and want to deliver better products, services, and experiences to the American public.</p>
			<p>Fellows are agile, collaborative, innovative, resourceful, strategic, and able to deliver measurable results in challenging environments. Fellows are holistic thinkers, digital trailblazers, and technical leaders that will help define the future of government services and shape digital policy.</p>
			<p>Fellows are building products and services at scale to serve all Americans. Below are examples of current projects from our Fall 2019 cohort, and we will be posting projects for the Fall 2020 cohort soon. We plan on working with many of our current agencies and expand to new agencies as well.</p>
