      <h2>Who we are</h2>
      <p>Presidential Innovation Fellows aspires to be as diverse as the people we serve. We’re a multidisciplinary team of product designers, full-stack engineers, and VC-backed founders. We’re also artists. Parents. Immigrants. Veterans. Walking into the office, we all share a passion for civic purpose—people helping people.</p>

      <h2>What we do</h2>
      <p>We unite leaders across sectors to co-create bold solutions for and with our government and our people. Hand-in-hand with federal agency leaders, we identify innovation opportunities of critical agency and/or national priority. As we do so, our team recruits outstanding private-sector talent. And then, we unite. PIF embeds the nation's top technologists, designers, and strategists within agencies as yearlong entrepreneurs in residence. With our agency partners, PIFs advise, rapidly prototype, and scale solutions using industry best practices across data science, design, engineering, product, and systems thinking. Our fellows serve as both strategic advisors <i>and</i> leaders who can build, test, and ship solutions.</p>

      <h1>Our story</h1>
      <p>Whenever our nation has faced unprecedented challenges, our innovators and entrepreneurs have used technology and design thinking to bring solutions to life and move our country forward. The Presidential Innovation Fellows program was launched in 2012 by former U.S. Chief Technology Officer Todd Park to equip our country with a powerful, scalable framework to innovate and address the greatest challenges facing our leaders and people. PIF provides a path for bringing private-sector talent with cutting-edge skills, customer obsession, and emerging-tech leadership into the Federal government.</p>
      <p>Since 2012, more than 150 Fellows have worked within over 35 federal agencies. Presidential Innovation Fellows help establish some of the nation’s top digital efforts, including 18F and the U.S. Digital Service (USDS). Over half of Fellows have decided to stay in government after the PIF program, and have gone on to lead new digital teams and serve as chief technology officers, chief information officers, chief data officers, and chief marketing officers at various agencies.</p>
