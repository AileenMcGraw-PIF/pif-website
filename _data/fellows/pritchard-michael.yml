He earned a commendation from NASA for his work in machine learning with industrial robots. He worked on a variety of real-world problems that ranged from mine detection with UWB radar to navigation in GPS-denied environments. He then founded his first startup and has had the startup bug ever since. During the last 20 years, Mike has been a founder, investor, developer, board member, and advisor.
