<h5><b>SOLUTION</b>: In less than 30 days, a team of Presidential Innovation Fellows and 18F staff built NotAlone.gov, a website containing typically disparate and often difficult-to-find information for students, schools, and anyone interested in finding resources on how to prevent and respond to sexual assault on college campuses and in schools.</h5>"
