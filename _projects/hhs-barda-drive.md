The current technology investment Areas of Interest that form the core of DRIVe’s approach to health security issues are: Solving Sepsis, ENACT (Early Notification to Act, Control, and Treat), and ODIs (Other Disruptive Innovations) and rapidly deployable capabilities. These areas of interest are balanced by a team whose mission is to seek innovation in business practices and processes​ which greatly improve upon the current technology and response landscape. As COVID-19 continues to ravage communities across the country, DRIVe has added the search for innovations in COVID-19 diagnostics, therapeutics, vaccines and other innovative approaches. For example, DRIVe has supported the development of 16 diagnostics for COVID-19, many of which have now received emergency use authorization from the FDA.

Aligning with DRIVe’s mission to continually reinvent how we do business to save lives and protect Americans, we are seeking a Presidential Innovation Fellow (PIF) with deep industry and entrepreneurial perspectives to support one or both of the following:
<ul>
  <li>Help design and build a 21st century data management system capable of (a) collecting, analyzing, and developing AI/ML algorithms, using data from BARDA-supported projects, to advance disease detection, analysis, and other health security needs, (b) perform broad-ranging market intelligence to help BARDA identify areas of investment and partnership opportunity, and (c) track and visualize global activity on product development, clinical trials, and other related data. This project is part of a larger BARDA-wide data strategy that the Fellow will be asked to help build and implement.</li>
  <li>Help DRIVe refine its current approach to rapidly advancing new technologies by helping the team better (a) engage private sector industry to form technology thrust areas for potential new DRIVe starts, (b) develop potential investment strategy for new DRIVe programs, and (c) advise portfolio companies to help them mature as an organization; drive follow-on funding; assist with scaling partnerships. We are also seeking Fellows who can help DRIVe incorporate usability, human-centered design, and ergonomic design into our approach to sourcing and funding new technologies and designing pilot studies across a variety of technology types, including continuous wearable monitors, microneedle patches and other alternate drug delivery vehicles.</li>
</ul>
