subtitle: "Accelerating the adoption of digital acquisition practices within government agencies."

description: "<p>The federal government spends about $80 billion yearly on information technology purchases, but doesn’t always receive the full value’s worth of that money. Fortunately, there are a number of proven practices such as human-centered design and agile software development that can help close the gap. But how can agencies adapt their acquisition policies, processes, and team structures to take advantage of these new and promising ways of working?</p>

<p>The Digital Acquisition Accelerator is a pilot program aimed at helping agencies accelerate the adoption of digital acquisition practices.</p>


<p>We provide agencies with the skills, knowledge, and tools they need to succeed with digital acquisitions, coaching them through five phases:</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>Ignition</b>. Identifying a cross-functional team as a cohort to undergo basic training on human-centered design, lean-agile methodologies, open innovation.</li>
	<li><b>Inception</b>. Developing an effective product and project vision through techniques such as proto-personas, problem deconstruction, and user-story mapping.</li>
	<li><b>Procurement</b>. Planning and executing a procurement plan in alignment with the product and project vision, coaching acquisitions teams through modular contracting.</li>
	<li><b>Delivery</b>. Applying modern practices to contract and project management when working with vendor(s) to produce a valuable, adaptable, and reliable product.</li>
	<li><b>Landing</b>. Capturing the results, lessons learned, and stories that can be reused by other government agencies.</li>
</ul>

<p>The first cohort of the Digital Acquisition Accelerator kicked off June 2016 two teams from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the U.S. Department of Treasury.</p>"
