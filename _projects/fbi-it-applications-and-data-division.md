To stop today’s high-tech criminals and terrorists, we need the very best information technology—from computers and laptops to software and servers. We are moving forward aggressively to build better and faster networks; innovative IT tools and applications for agents and other professionals; and automated systems that streamline our work and free up our time. The Information and Technology Branch, or ITB, leads this effort in the FBI.

The Information and Technology Branch (ITB) is composed of three divisions (approximately 1,800 government and contract employees) that together represent the information technology (IT) life cycle and management of knowledge assets. The IT Applications and Data Division (ITADD) will decrease time to data awareness of available information and make software tools available to the workforce when and where they need it.

The FBI's IT Applications and Data Division is looking for Presidential Innovation Fellows to work on two IT modernization efforts:

### FBI Data Lake
The FBI IT Applications and Data Division owns the majority of enterprise systems and applications. They have created an enterprise compute and analytics platform, which will enable powerful analytics and correlation across a vast collection of data sets. Currently, the team is working on building up core services of the data lake, working on user interface and accessibility for end users, and ingesting data sets and systems. The division needs a PIF with knowledge of data ingest at scale, systems thinking experience, and big data innovation to help improve this process and product.

### Cloud Adoption and Transformation
The FBI is in the process of moving some systems to on premises virtualized environments and commercial cloud, and a PIF with knowledge of application hosting decisions and enterprise-scale cloud adoption would be beneficial. The FBI needs someone who can assess, identify, and recommend architectural improvements as part of cloud migrations, and after migration, optimization opportunities. Additionally, someone with experience in the finances of commercial cloud, who can design a payment accounts model, that holds people accountable and monitors cloud spend across the division.
