description: "<p>The USDA Secretary’s Office of Customer Experience (OCX) is a USDA homegrown initiative powered by and for employees. We run this office like a start-up, meaning we are built with scrappy, cross-functional teams, we think big, start small then scale, we operate as a meritocracy (your talent is your value, not your pedigree or rank), decisions are fueled by data, and we iterate and pivot based on what is of value to our customers (the USDA employees). As a senior advisor to the Chief Customer Officer (CCO), you will be integral to building a permanent CX office that is sustainable for the future. The CCO reports to the Assistant Secretary for Administration with a dotted line to the USDA Deputy Secretary, who serves as USDA’s Chief Operating Officer. Although you report to the CCO, you will work closely with the entire team, as well as with our agency CX Champions, who amplify our work and serve as liaisons to their agencies across USDA. USDA is a global organization with 100,000 employees, divided into 8 Mission Areas across which are 17 agencies.</p>"

description_more: "<p>OCX core capabilities fall into the categories Listen, Act, and Engage:</p>
<p>Listen:</p>
<ul>
  <li>OneUSDA Contact Center and Knowledgebase: Phase 1 CoE assessment revealed 59 different phone numbers and 27 public-facing contact centers to access USDA. By mid-July, we are planning to go live with a OneUSDA Contact Center “front door” that will handle basic inquiries over web/phone/email (supported by the centralized Knowledgebase tool) with a warm transfer to USDA subject matter experts for more complex inquiries.</li>
  <li>Voice of the Customer program: This platform will pull real-time customer feedback from various channels (e.g. Tell Sonny, service center comment cards, customer satisfaction surveys, call center inquiries, website analytics) to one location from which custom reports and a CX Dashboard will be generated. The VoC tool also offers a customer relationship management framework that tracks customer interactions. Future state for this project includes a Voice of the Employee component. OCX will flag areas of concern for agencies to enable them to utilize the data for decision-making and strategy focused on impact on customers.</li>
</ul>

<p>Act:</p>
<ul>
  <li>CX Project Teams: The CX CoE brings expertise in user experience research, CX strategy, and data analysis and visualization to engage and train employees to co-create—with their customers—tools and programs the address pain points and improve processes.</li>
  <li>Web Modernization: The goal of this project is to provide guidance and assistance to Mission Areas for modernizing USDA’s 10 most visited public sites (including USDA.gov and Farmers.gov), starting with a report on website analytics (completed), a Digital Playbook on how to modernize your website, and pilot projects.</li>
  <li>Agency CX Champions: OCX empowers CX Champions from each agency to shepherd customer-focused initiatives on an annual cycle.</li>
</ul>

<p>Engage</p>
<ul>
  <li>OneUSDA All-Employee site: OCX is gathering feedback from employees department-wide to build an internal site accessible only to employees on their desktops or mobile devices. The site aims to foster a culture that continually improves customer experience by ensuring each employee has access to clear, consistent communication from leadership, tools to share their ideas and feedback, and an understanding of their role as part of a unified team. The 5-week feedback campaign runs to the end of April, and the beta launch of the site is scheduled for June.</li>
  <li>Employee engagement: through review of internal communications, quarterly recognition/engagement events, and an Employee’s Choice Honors Award (as part of the Secretary’s Honor Awards program), OCX will help celebrate employees and empower them through shared, consistent information that is created from the user’s perspective.</li>
</ul>

<p>You will be assigned projects that are aligned with your strengths and will be charged with charting a path for yourself that fills you with passion. All of our projects are rapid-paced, because we want to get your minimally viable product/program out amongst the people to start testing right away. This job is not for the faint of heart--we are an intense, passionate, raucous bunch who believe in radical candor and collaboration. But don't worry--we have plenty of introverts on board--they are just experts at managing their boundaries.</p>"
